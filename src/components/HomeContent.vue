        A natatorium (plural: natatoria) is a building containing a<br />
        swimming pool.[1] In Latin, a cella natatoria was a swimming pool<br />
        in its own building, although it is sometimes also used to refer<br />
        to any indoor pool even if not housed in a dedicated building<br />
        (e.g., a pool in a school or a fitness club).[2] It will usually<br />
        also house locker rooms, and perhaps allied activities, such as a<br />
        diving well or facilities for water polo. Many colleges,<br />
        universities and high schools have natatoria.<br />
